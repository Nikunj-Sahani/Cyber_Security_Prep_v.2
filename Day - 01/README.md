# DNS ( Domain Name System )
DNS translates domain names into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.

- For Example - Google.com
- Search ⏩ Google.com ⏩ Get IP ⏩ Result in Browser

## TLD - Top Level Domain
It’s the last part of a domain name, appearing after the dot (.).
- 📘 Example : 
> - **.in**
> - **.org**
> - **.com**
> - **.edu**
> - **.gov**

# OSI Model
It is a framework that explains **how data travels from one device to another** over a network.

- **7 Layers in OSI Model**
  
  > - **Application Layer**
  > - **Presentation Layer**
  > - **Session Layer**
  > - **Transport Layer**
  > - **Network Layer**
  > - **Data Link Layer**
  > - **Physical Layer**

## ICANN - Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
- Global management of Domain Names, IP Addresses & DNS.
- **Purpose -** Ensure that **internet is Organized, accessible and secure.**

## IANA - Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.
- IANA is a sub-organization of ICANN
- It manages *IP addresses, DNS root zones, and protocol assignments for the Internet.*

# Types of Communication
> - Unicasting :: **One-to-One**
> - Multicasting :: **Single-to-Multiple**
> - Broadcasting :: **One to All**

- **UniCasting -** Data is sent from one sender to another receiver.
   > - Example : *Person A ⏩ Person B*
   
- **MultiCasting -** Single sender to Mulitple reciever.
   > - Example : *Person A ⏩ Person B , Person C, Person D.*

- **BroadCasting -** One Sender send to All Reciever in Same Network.
   > - Example : *Broadband*- One to All

  - **Limited Broadcasting -** Sent to all hosts within the local network.
  - **Direct Broadcasting -** Sent to all hosts in a specific network.

# Modes of Communications
It is a Part of Transmission Mode.
 > - Simplex Mode
 > - Half Duplex
 > - Full Duplex

- **Simplex Mode -** Simplex is a one-way communication mode — **data flows in only one direction.**
   > - Only one device transmits, and the other only receives.
   > - **Example -** Keyboard → CPU (keyboard sends data only)

- **Half Duplex Mode -** A two-way communication mode, **but data flows in one direction at a time.**
   > - Both devices can send and receive, but not at the same time.
   > - **When one device is transmitting, the other must wait.**
   > - Example : Walkie-talkies (you say “over” after speaking)

- **Full Duplex Mode -**
