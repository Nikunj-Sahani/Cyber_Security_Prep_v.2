## About Internet
- **Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn** : Known as the *“Fathers of the Internet”.*
> - Invented the TCP/IP protocol.

- **Tim Berners-Lee** - Invented the *World Wide Web (WWW)* in 1989 while working at CERN.
> - Created HTML, HTTP, and first web browser—making the internet accessible to public.

# DNS ( Domain Name System )
DNS translates domain names into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.

- For Example - Google.com
- Search ⏩ Google.com ⏩ Get IP ⏩ Result in Browser

## TLD - Top Level Domain
It’s the last part of a domain name, appearing after the dot (.).
- 📘 Example : 
> - **.in**
> - **.org**
> - **.com**
> - **.edu**
> - **.gov**

---
# OSI Model
It is a framework that explains **how data travels from one device to another** over a network.

- **7 Layers in OSI Model**
  
  > - **Application Layer**
  > - **Presentation Layer**
  > - **Session Layer**
  > - **Transport Layer**
  > - **Network Layer**
  > - **Data Link Layer**
  > - **Physical Layer**

---
## ICANN - Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
- Global management of Domain Names, IP Addresses & DNS.
- **Purpose -** Ensure that **internet is Organized, accessible and secure.**

## IANA - Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.
- IANA is a sub-organization of ICANN
- It manages *IP addresses, DNS root zones, and protocol assignments for the Internet.*

# Types of Communication
> - Unicasting :: **One-to-One**
> - Multicasting :: **Single-to-Multiple**
> - Broadcasting :: **One to All**

- **UniCasting -** Data is sent from one sender to another receiver.
   > - Example : *Person A ⏩ Person B*
   
- **MultiCasting -** Single sender to Mulitple reciever.
   > - Example : *Person A ⏩ Person B , Person C, Person D.*

- **BroadCasting -** One Sender send to All Reciever in Same Network.
   > - Example : *Broadband*- One to All

  - **Limited Broadcasting -** Sent to all hosts within the local network.
  - **Direct Broadcasting -** Sent to all hosts in a specific network.

---
# Modes of Communications
It is a Part of Transmission Mode.
 > - Simplex Mode
 > - Half Duplex
 > - Full Duplex

- **Simplex Mode -** Simplex is a one-way communication mode — **data flows in only one direction.**
   > - Only one device transmits, and the other only receives.
   > - **Example -** Keyboard → CPU (keyboard sends data only)

- **Half Duplex Mode -** A two-way communication mode, **but data flows in one direction at a time.**
   > - Both devices can send and receive, but not at the same time.
   > - **When one device is transmitting, the other must wait.**
   > - Example : Walkie-talkies (you say “over” after speaking)

- **Full Duplex Mode -** A two-way communication mode **where data flows in both directions.**
   > - Both devices can send and receive at the same time.
   > - Example : Telephone calls (both people talk and listen at once) , Video conferencing

# Types of Computer Networks
Computer network is a Connection of devices to communicate & share data and resources.

> - **PAN : Personal Area Network**
> - **LAN : Local Area Network**
> - **MAN : Metropolitan Area Network**
> - **WAN : Wide Area Network**
> - **CAN : Campus Area Network**

- **1. PAN :-** It is small range network , Connects personal devices like phones, laptops, Bluetooth devices.
   > - *Example :* Mobile Hotspot , Bluetooth

- **2. LAN :-** It covers a small area like a home, office, or school. *It may wired & wireless.**
   > - *Example :* Wifi in Home or Office , Computer and Printer on same network

- **3. CAN :-** It is used to connect multiple buildings in one campus. *Connects multiple LANs within a campus or organization.*
   > - *Example :* University network connecting the library, hostels, and classrooms together.

- **4. MAN :-** It covers a city or large campus in a network.
   > - *Example :* City wide Wifi network.

- **5. WAN :-** It covers large geographical areas, connects multiple LANs/MANs.
   > - *Example :* The Internet, Connect Many city Network or Global.

# Network Topology
It shows how they are connected and how data flows between them.

> - Point-to-Point Topology
> - Bus Topology
> - Ring Topology
> - Star Topology
> - Tree Topology
> - Hybrid Topology
> - Mesh Topology

- **1. Point-to-Point Topology :-** Simple communication between two nodes, *one is sender and other is reciever.*

- **2. Bus Topology :-** It connects all devices to a single central cable, *If the main cable fails, entire network goes down.*

- **3. Ring Topology :-** Each device is connected with two other devices, forming a ring loop (circle).
   > - Data travels in one direction around the ring *until it reaches its destination.*
   > - **It uses large numbers of Repeaters for per node, Repeaters prevent data loss.**

- **4. Star Topology :-**
  
- **2. Bus Topology :-**
- **2. Bus Topology :-**
- **2. Bus Topology :-**
